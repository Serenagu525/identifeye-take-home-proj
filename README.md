## RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. After pulling from this repo, go to "edit scheme" -> "Run" -> "Options" and enable "Use custom working directory". Set it to the client-exam-project folder. This will make the txt file paths work. 
2. To aggregate data for individual txt file, run aggregateData(from: filepath).
3. To run basic functionality tests I implemented, run my_tests(). True will be returned if all three tests passed. Tests are implemented for the example input given in pdf, all edge cases specified in pdf, and a more extensive test covering cases like longer names and multiple deletes.
